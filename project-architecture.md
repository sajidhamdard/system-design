Excellent — you gave **very clear and structured info**, so I can easily stitch this into a clean, **interview-ready architecture flow** for you.

Let’s nail it.

---

# **Your Project Architecture — Clean End-to-End Flow**

## **1. Frontend (Angular + Web Components)**

* You have a **main Angular app** (`www.wecode.com`)
  → It contains **multiple sub-apps** as **Web Components** (micro frontends)
* **Routing** inside Angular decides which **Web Component** (sub-app) to load
* Each Web Component **calls its own backend API** (via domain like `api.wecode.com/students-api/...`)

---

## **2. API Gateway (Apigee)**

* **All frontend API calls go to Apigee first** (not directly to services)
* Apigee responsibilities:

  * Authentication & Authorization (with **Okta**)
  * Rate limiting, caching, security policies
  * Routing requests to appropriate backend microservices
    (e.g., route `/students-api/...` → to **Students Service**)

---

## **3. Backend Services (Spring Boot Microservices)**

* Each **API** (like `/students-api`) is backed by a **Spring Boot service**
* Developers code the microservice → **builds with Jenkins**
* Jenkins **builds Docker images** and pushes them to **Private Docker Registry** (`artifactory.wecode.com`)

---

## **4. Deployment (GitOps + Spinnaker + Kubernetes)**

* You have **GitOps repos** (YAML manifests) → One per service + env (dev, qa, prod)
* You update:

  * **Docker image tag** (new build)
  * **Replica count** (number of Pods)
* **Spinnaker watches GitOps repo**
  → Automatically triggers deployment to **Azure Kubernetes cluster**
* K8s creates/updates **Pods** for each microservice
  → You verify running Pods via **Azure cloud dashboard**

---

## **5. Auth Flow (Okta)**

* Frontend gets **JWT tokens** (OAuth / OIDC) from **Okta**
* Frontend sends token in **Authorization header** of every API call
* Apigee **validates token** (with Okta) before routing to backend
* If token invalid/expired → Apigee returns **403 error**

---

## **6. High Availability + Scalability**

* Apigee handles **external load balancing + API security**
* Kubernetes handles:

  * **Service discovery**
  * **Internal load balancing** (across Pods)
  * **Auto-healing** (restarts Pods if they fail)
  * **Scaling** (manual/auto based on load)

---

# **What to say in interview? (Clean summary)**

> *“We have a micro-frontend architecture where an Angular app loads various Web Components, each calling its respective backend APIs via Apigee API Gateway. Apigee handles authentication (via Okta), security, and routing. Backend microservices are Spring Boot apps containerized via Jenkins and stored in a private Docker registry. Deployments are fully automated using a GitOps model where Spinnaker triggers Kubernetes deployments (Azure AKS) based on YAML manifest updates. Kubernetes ensures service discovery, load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.”*

---

# **Why is this modern and scalable? (If interviewer asks)**

* **API Gateway decouples security/routing from services**
* **Micro-frontends** enable independent feature delivery
* **CI/CD (Jenkins + Spinnaker + GitOps)** gives safe, automated deploys
* **Kubernetes** handles infra resilience and scalability

---

If you want, I can also give:

* **Sample interview diagram** (very clean)
* **What happens during a deployment? (step-by-step)**

Want that next? (optional)


Yes — most likely **those kinds of errors are coming from Apigee** (your API Gateway).

Let me explain why very clearly.

---

# **Why you get errors like "Only X characters allowed" / "Max 10 MB data allowed"**

These types of errors are **API Gateway policy enforcement errors** — not directly from your backend service.

Apigee **sits in front** of all your backend APIs and it applies **policies** like:

| Policy Type                      | Example                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Request/Response Size Limits** | Max request payload size = 10MB    |
| **Header Size Limit**            | Max header length = X characters   |
| **Query Param Validation**       | Max param length, allowed patterns |
| **Content Type Validation**      | Only accept JSON, not XML          |
| **Rate Limits / Quotas**         | Max 1000 requests per minute       |
| **Timeouts**                     | Request must finish in X seconds   |
| **Security Policies**            | Disallow file uploads over X MB    |

If any of these **policies fail**, Apigee throws an error **before even calling your backend service**
That’s why:

* You see **400/413 errors**
* Or messages like *"Payload too large"*, *"Parameter too long"*

---

# **Real Example (Apigee policy config)**

Here’s how an Apigee policy to limit payload might look:

```xml
<Step>
  <Name>VerifyPayloadSize</Name>
</Step>

<Javascript name="VerifyPayloadSize">
  <Properties>
    <Property name="maxPayloadSize">10485760</Property> <!-- 10 MB -->
  </Properties>
  <ResourceURL>jsc://verifyPayloadSize.js</ResourceURL>
</Javascript>
```

Or directly with a **built-in policy**:

```xml
<SpikeArrest name="limit-payload">
  <Properties>
    <Property name="maxRequestSize">10MB</Property>
  </Properties>
</SpikeArrest>
```

---

# **Clean interview explanation (if asked)**

> *“Apigee can enforce API governance policies like payload size limits, header size limits, query param validation, and content type restrictions. When we see errors like 'only 10 MB allowed' or 'param too long', those are typically enforced by Apigee policies to protect backend services and ensure API stability.”*

---

# **Bonus — Why these limits exist (good to mention in interview)**

* Prevent **DoS attacks** (user sends 1GB file → server crashes)
* Ensure **fair usage** and **predictable performance**
* Protect **backend services** from unexpected large data
* Enforce **API contract consistency** (like max 255 chars param)

---

# **How to confirm it’s Apigee error (in real project)**

* **Check Apigee response code** — usually it returns 4xx with **policy error message**
* **Backend service logs** — If backend was not hit at all → it’s Apigee
* **Apigee policies config** — Your Apigee team can confirm configured limits

---

**Short answer:**
Yes, **those limits are coming from Apigee**, not from your backend Spring Boot service.

---

If you want, I can also show **how Spring Boot itself can enforce similar limits** (in case it’s backend sometimes).
Would you like that?



Perfect — now you’ve introduced another **API management component**: **Axway**.

Let me explain very clearly what’s going on here — and how **Axway** fits into your architecture along with **Apigee**.

---

# **What is Axway? (In your project context)**

In your project, **Axway** is used as an **API Management / API Security Gateway**, very similar to Apigee.
It helps with:

* Managing **API specifications / API contracts** (like OpenAPI specs)
* Governing **which APIs are officially exposed and allowed**
* Controlling **access control**, **API lifecycle**, and **API publishing**

Basically:

> **Axway is maintaining the “official allowed API catalog”**.
> If an API is **not registered/declared** properly in Axway → it is considered **unauthorized** → you get **403 Forbidden**.

---

# **Your GitOps repo → Axway folder → API Specs**

That folder contains:

* **API specifications** (OpenAPI / Swagger files)
* **Policies or metadata** saying which APIs are published, versioned, allowed

When you **deploy a new backend service** (say "Students API") —
If that API’s **spec** is not present or not registered correctly in the **Axway repo**,
Axway **blocks requests** to it and returns **403 Forbidden**
(*“This API is not allowed / not published / not authorized”*)

---

# **Clean flow of what’s happening**

```
Frontend Angular
      ↓
api.wecode.com (Apigee API Gateway)
      ↓
→ Apigee authenticates token (Okta)
→ Apigee checks routing

Apigee sends request to:
↓
Axway API Manager
→ Is this API spec registered and allowed? (From GitOps Axway folder)
   - Yes → forward to backend service
   - No  → 403 Forbidden (blocked)

↓
Backend Spring Boot Service (in Kubernetes)
```

---

# **Why are both Apigee AND Axway used?**

In many enterprises (like yours),
**Apigee** is used mainly as the **external API Gateway** (handling client traffic, security, token validation)

And **Axway** is used as a **central API management / governance platform** to:

* Manage **API specs, versioning, catalog**
* Control **which APIs are published / allowed**
* Govern **internal APIs and partner APIs**
  (Sometimes it enforces more strict enterprise-level policies)

---

# **Interview-ready explanation (if asked)**

> *“In our project, Apigee handles external API Gateway tasks like authentication and routing, while Axway governs API specifications and ensures only registered, approved APIs are accessible. If a new backend API is deployed but not registered in Axway via our GitOps specs folder, Axway blocks the request and returns a 403 Forbidden error, ensuring API governance and security compliance.”*

---

# **So to answer you clearly**

**Yes — the 403 Forbidden you mentioned (for new APIs)**
→ It is because **Axway is blocking that API** due to **missing or unregistered spec**
→ You need to **add the API spec** in **GitOps Axway folder** to allow traffic

---

If you want — I can show you **exact example structure of that Axway folder**
and **what files typically go there** so you can confidently talk about it.

Would you like that?


Axway is **not specific to your project**; it’s actually a well-known, **enterprise-grade** API management platform used by many organizations for managing, securing, and governing APIs.

So, **Axway** is a **real product** and is commonly used in industries that deal with complex API ecosystems, needing advanced control over their APIs, such as:

* **API Gateway**
* **API Security**
* **API Lifecycle Management**
* **Analytics and Monitoring for APIs**
* **Developer Portals**

### Key Features of Axway:

1. **API Gateway**: Manages API traffic and secures it (similar to Apigee). It supports **rate limiting**, **authentication**, **API routing**, and more.
2. **API Management**: Allows enterprises to define, register, and control **which APIs are exposed** (and which are not). Provides **security policies**, **access control**, **versioning** of APIs.
3. **Security**: Enforces security policies like **OAuth**, **rate limiting**, **throttling**, and more. It also helps with **monitoring** and **logging**.
4. **API Analytics**: Offers analytics to track usage patterns, error rates, and API performance metrics.
5. **API Lifecycle**: It helps manage the entire lifecycle of an API (from design to deprecation).

---

### **Axway in General**

Axway is **widely used** across many industries, not just yours. Some of the use cases for Axway could include:

* **Banking & Financial Services**: Managing secure APIs to allow third-party services to interact with their systems.
* **Retail**: Managing the API traffic between web applications and internal systems.
* **Healthcare**: Securing API interactions between hospitals, pharmacies, and insurers.

### **Axway API Management Solutions Include**:

* **Axway API Gateway**: A powerful tool to secure, scale, and monitor APIs.
* **Axway Amplify**: A platform that helps businesses with API integration and delivery.
* **Axway Centralized Analytics**: For monitoring and analyzing API traffic.

### **Axway’s Role in Your Project**

In your specific project, it seems that **Axway** is playing the role of **API Governance**. You are using it for managing and securing your APIs (defining which are allowed, handling access control, etc.). When you get errors like **403 Forbidden** for new APIs, it's because **Axway hasn't registered or authorized that API** yet.

### **Short Explanation for Interview/Clarity:**

> *“Axway is an API management and governance platform used for securing and managing APIs. It allows enterprises to define, monitor, and control which APIs are exposed to clients. In our case, Axway is used to ensure that only approved and registered APIs are accessible. When new APIs are deployed but not registered, Axway blocks them, leading to 403 errors.”*

---

So, **Axway** is a product used for API management and **is not something unique to your project**. It’s widely used in the industry for complex API ecosystems.



Good — you are thinking about **Micro Frontends** architecture now.

Let’s explain your setup **in simple words**:

---

# **Your Frontend Setup: Micro Frontends Using Web Components**

You have:

* One **Main Angular app** (like `wecode-frontend`)
* Several **sub-applications** (small Angular apps or other apps), built as **Web Components**

Each **sub-app** is:

* In a **separate Git repo**
* Built **independently** (just like backend services)
* Deployed separately (maybe to some cloud storage, CDN, or server)

These sub-apps are **Web Components** — meaning:

* They are compiled into **custom HTML elements** (like `<student-app></student-app>`, `<teacher-app></teacher-app>`, etc.)
* They are **framework-agnostic** (once built, you can use them in any app, not just Angular)

---

# **How Main Frontend Loads These Web Components**

### 1. **Build and Host**

Each micro frontend (web component) is built separately → produces **JavaScript bundles** (e.g., `student-app.js`).

These JS bundles are uploaded somewhere (S3 bucket, Azure blob storage, or static servers).

---

### 2. **Main App Loads Dynamically**

In the **main Angular app**:

* You have a **configuration (like in package.json, or a config file)** where you define:

  * URL to load the web component (JS file)
  * Name of the custom element (e.g., `<student-app>`)

* When user navigates to a certain route (say `/students`),
  → The main app dynamically **loads that JS bundle** at runtime
  → Browser **registers** the new web component
  → You **render the custom element** like a normal HTML tag

**Example**:

```html
<!-- Inside Main Angular App -->
<student-app></student-app>
```

**Behind the scenes**:

* Main app downloads `student-app.js`
* Registers it
* Shows the Student Application seamlessly inside the main app

---

# **Summary of the Full Flow**

| Step | What happens                                                                |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Each web component is built separately and hosted somewhere                 |
| 2    | Main Angular app has a config mapping URL and web component name            |
| 3    | When user navigates to a specific route, the main app loads the JS bundle   |
| 4    | Browser registers the Web Component                                         |
| 5    | Main app renders the custom element like a normal Angular component         |
| 6    | Web component runs its own Angular code internally, independent of main app |

---

# **Bonus: Why this Micro Frontend Architecture?**

* Teams can develop/deploy **independently**
* Faster builds (small apps instead of a huge monolith)
* Different tech stacks possible (though all yours are Angular for now)
* Easy scaling and modularization

---

# **Small Interview-Ready Summary**

> *“In our project, we use a micro frontend architecture where each web component is a separately developed and deployed application. The main Angular app dynamically loads these web components based on user navigation. It treats them like standard HTML elements, allowing independent deployment and scaling of different parts of the application.”*

---

Would you also like me to draw a small **architecture diagram** showing this micro frontend setup clearly?
It will help you **explain confidently in interviews** too.
(very simple, clean one).
Should I?


Good — now we’re moving to the **build and deployment part** of your architecture.
Let me explain **Docker** and **Artifactory** very clearly, step by step.

---

# **1. What is Docker?**

**Docker** is a tool that **packages** your application (code + dependencies + environment) into a **Docker Image**.
That image can run **anywhere** (on your laptop, server, cloud) — exactly the same way.

### **Why do we use Docker?**

Because:

* No more "It works on my machine" problem
* The same Docker image can run in **dev**, **QA**, **stage**, **prod** — no surprises
* Easy to deploy, scale, and manage applications

---

### **Example**

Your **Student Service** (Spring Boot app) → You want to Dockerize it.

You write a **Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk
COPY target/student-service.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

When you run **`docker build`**, it creates a **Docker Image** → e.g.,
`student-service:v1.0`

This image contains:

* JDK
* Your compiled `.jar` file
* Everything needed to run it

---

# **2. What is Artifactory?**

**Artifactory** is like a **storage** or **repository** (just like Git stores code, Artifactory stores built artifacts).
In your case, it stores **Docker images** and maybe **JARs**, **NPM packages**, etc.

You can think of it as:

> *"A private DockerHub / Maven Central for your company."*

---

### **Why do we use Artifactory?**

Because:

* Company wants to store all Docker images **privately**
* You can **version** your images → `student-service:v1.0`, `v2.0`, etc.
* Secure access, faster downloads within organization

---

### **Example Flow**

| Step | What happens                                                                    |
| :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | You build Docker Image of Student Service on Jenkins                            |
| 2    | Jenkins **pushes** that image to **Artifactory** (your private Docker registry) |
| 3    | During deployment, Kubernetes pulls that image from Artifactory and deploys it  |

---

# **Your Project Flow — Docker + Artifactory**

1. **Developer** writes code (Spring Boot)
2. **Jenkins** builds the code → creates Docker image
   → e.g., `student-service:v1.2`
3. **Jenkins pushes** that image to **Artifactory** → `artifactory.wecode.com`
4. You update `.yaml` file (GitOps repo) with **new image tag**
   → e.g., `image: artifactory.wecode.com/student-service:v1.2`
5. **Spinnaker** sees the change and triggers deployment on Kubernetes
6. Kubernetes **pulls image** from Artifactory → runs it in a pod

---

| Tool            | Simple Definition                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker**      | Packages application + dependencies into portable container images       |
| **Artifactory** | Private repository to store Docker images (and other artifacts) securely |
| **Jenkins**     | CI/CD tool to automate build, test, and deployment                       |
| **Spinnaker**   | Continuous delivery tool to automate deployments (works with K8s)        |

---

# **Your Interview-Ready Summary**

> *“In our project, we use Docker to package backend services into images. Jenkins builds and pushes these images to our private Artifactory (Docker registry). Kubernetes then pulls the images from Artifactory and deploys them in pods, ensuring consistent environments across all stages.”*

If you want, next I can **map this clearly with your existing flow (frontend + backend)** so you get **complete clarity**.
Shall I?
