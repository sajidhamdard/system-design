# **Your Project Architecture — Clean End-to-End Flow**

## **1. Frontend (Angular + Web Components)**

* You have a **main Angular app** (`www.wecode.com`)
  → It contains **multiple sub-apps** as **Web Components** (micro frontends)
* **Routing** inside Angular decides which **Web Component** (sub-app) to load
* Each Web Component **calls its own backend API** (via domain like `api.wecode.com/students-api/...`)

---

## **2. API Gateway (Apigee)**

* **All frontend API calls go to Apigee first** (not directly to services)
* Apigee responsibilities:

  * Authentication & Authorization (with **Okta**)
  * Rate limiting, caching, security policies
  * Routing requests to appropriate backend microservices
    (e.g., route `/students-api/...` → to **Students Service**)

---

## **3. Backend Services (Spring Boot Microservices)**

* Each **API** (like `/students-api`) is backed by a **Spring Boot service**
* Developers code the microservice → **builds with Jenkins**
* Jenkins **builds Docker images** and pushes them to **Private Docker Registry** (`artifactory.wecode.com`)

---

## **4. Deployment (GitOps + Spinnaker + Kubernetes)**

* You have **GitOps repos** (YAML manifests) → One per service + env (dev, qa, prod)
* You update:

  * **Docker image tag** (new build)
  * **Replica count** (number of Pods)
* **Spinnaker watches GitOps repo**
  → Automatically triggers deployment to **Azure Kubernetes cluster**
* K8s creates/updates **Pods** for each microservice
  → You verify running Pods via **Azure cloud dashboard**

---

## **5. Auth Flow (Okta)**

* Frontend gets **JWT tokens** (OAuth / OIDC) from **Okta**
* Frontend sends token in **Authorization header** of every API call
* Apigee **validates token** (with Okta) before routing to backend
* If token invalid/expired → Apigee returns **403 error**

---

## **6. High Availability + Scalability**

* Apigee handles **external load balancing + API security**
* Kubernetes handles:

  * **Service discovery**
  * **Internal load balancing** (across Pods)
  * **Auto-healing** (restarts Pods if they fail)
  * **Scaling** (manual/auto based on load)

# **What to say in interview? (Clean summary)**

> *“We have a micro-frontend architecture where an Angular app loads various Web Components, each calling its respective backend APIs via Apigee API Gateway. Apigee handles authentication (via Okta), security, and routing. Backend microservices are Spring Boot apps containerized via Jenkins and stored in a private Docker registry. Deployments are fully automated using a GitOps model where Spinnaker triggers Kubernetes deployments (Azure AKS) based on YAML manifest updates. Kubernetes ensures service discovery, load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.”*

---

# **Why is this modern and scalable? (If interviewer asks)**

* **API Gateway decouples security/routing from services**
* **Micro-frontends** enable independent feature delivery
* **CI/CD (Jenkins + Spinnaker + GitOps)** gives safe, automated deploys
* **Kubernetes** handles infra resilience and scalability

---

# **Why you get errors like "Only X characters allowed" / "Max 10 MB data allowed"**

These types of errors are **API Gateway policy enforcement errors** — not directly from your backend service.

Apigee **sits in front** of all your backend APIs and it applies **policies** like:

| Policy Type                      | Example                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Request/Response Size Limits** | Max request payload size = 10MB    |
| **Header Size Limit**            | Max header length = X characters   |
| **Query Param Validation**       | Max param length, allowed patterns |
| **Content Type Validation**      | Only accept JSON, not XML          |
| **Rate Limits / Quotas**         | Max 1000 requests per minute       |
| **Timeouts**                     | Request must finish in X seconds   |
| **Security Policies**            | Disallow file uploads over X MB    |

If any of these **policies fail**, Apigee throws an error **before even calling your backend service**
That’s why:

* You see **400/413 errors**
* Or messages like *"Payload too large"*, *"Parameter too long"*

---

# **Real Example (Apigee policy config)**

Here’s how an Apigee policy to limit payload might look:

```xml
<Step>
  <Name>VerifyPayloadSize</Name>
</Step>

<Javascript name="VerifyPayloadSize">
  <Properties>
    <Property name="maxPayloadSize">10485760</Property> <!-- 10 MB -->
  </Properties>
  <ResourceURL>jsc://verifyPayloadSize.js</ResourceURL>
</Javascript>
```

Or directly with a **built-in policy**:

```xml
<SpikeArrest name="limit-payload">
  <Properties>
    <Property name="maxRequestSize">10MB</Property>
  </Properties>
</SpikeArrest>
```

---

# **Clean interview explanation (if asked)**

> *“Apigee can enforce API governance policies like payload size limits, header size limits, query param validation, and content type restrictions. When we see errors like 'only 10 MB allowed' or 'param too long', those are typically enforced by Apigee policies to protect backend services and ensure API stability.”*

---

# **Bonus — Why these limits exist (good to mention in interview)**

* Prevent **DoS attacks** (user sends 1GB file → server crashes)
* Ensure **fair usage** and **predictable performance**
* Protect **backend services** from unexpected large data
* Enforce **API contract consistency** (like max 255 chars param)

---

# **How to confirm it’s Apigee error (in real project)**

* **Check Apigee response code** — usually it returns 4xx with **policy error message**
* **Backend service logs** — If backend was not hit at all → it’s Apigee
* **Apigee policies config** — Your Apigee team can confirm configured limits

---

**Short answer:**
Yes, **those limits are coming from Apigee**, not from your backend Spring Boot service.

---

# **What is Axway? (In your project context)**

In your project, **Axway** is used as an **API Management / API Security Gateway**, very similar to Apigee.
It helps with:

* Managing **API specifications / API contracts** (like OpenAPI specs)
* Governing **which APIs are officially exposed and allowed**
* Controlling **access control**, **API lifecycle**, and **API publishing**

Basically:

> **Axway is maintaining the “official allowed API catalog”**.
> If an API is **not registered/declared** properly in Axway → it is considered **unauthorized** → you get **403 Forbidden**.

---

# **Your GitOps repo → Axway folder → API Specs**

That folder contains:

* **API specifications** (OpenAPI / Swagger files)
* **Policies or metadata** saying which APIs are published, versioned, allowed

When you **deploy a new backend service** (say "Students API") —
If that API’s **spec** is not present or not registered correctly in the **Axway repo**,
Axway **blocks requests** to it and returns **403 Forbidden**
(*“This API is not allowed / not published / not authorized”*)

---

# **Clean flow of what’s happening**

```
Frontend Angular
      ↓
api.wecode.com (Apigee API Gateway)
      ↓
→ Apigee authenticates token (Okta)
→ Apigee checks routing

Apigee sends request to:
↓
Axway API Manager
→ Is this API spec registered and allowed? (From GitOps Axway folder)
   - Yes → forward to backend service
   - No  → 403 Forbidden (blocked)

↓
Backend Spring Boot Service (in Kubernetes)
```

---

# **Why are both Apigee AND Axway used?**

In many enterprises (like yours),
**Apigee** is used mainly as the **external API Gateway** (handling client traffic, security, token validation)

And **Axway** is used as a **central API management / governance platform** to:

* Manage **API specs, versioning, catalog**
* Control **which APIs are published / allowed**
* Govern **internal APIs and partner APIs**
  (Sometimes it enforces more strict enterprise-level policies)

---

# **Interview-ready explanation (if asked)**

> *“In our project, Apigee handles external API Gateway tasks like authentication and routing, while Axway governs API specifications and ensures only registered, approved APIs are accessible. If a new backend API is deployed but not registered in Axway via our GitOps specs folder, Axway blocks the request and returns a 403 Forbidden error, ensuring API governance and security compliance.”*

---

# **So to answer you clearly**

**Yes — the 403 Forbidden you mentioned (for new APIs)**
→ It is because **Axway is blocking that API** due to **missing or unregistered spec**
→ You need to **add the API spec** in **GitOps Axway folder** to allow traffic

---


Axway is **not specific to your project**; it’s actually a well-known, **enterprise-grade** API management platform used by many organizations for managing, securing, and governing APIs.

So, **Axway** is a **real product** and is commonly used in industries that deal with complex API ecosystems, needing advanced control over their APIs, such as:

* **API Gateway**
* **API Security**
* **API Lifecycle Management**
* **Analytics and Monitoring for APIs**
* **Developer Portals**

### Key Features of Axway:

1. **API Gateway**: Manages API traffic and secures it (similar to Apigee). It supports **rate limiting**, **authentication**, **API routing**, and more.
2. **API Management**: Allows enterprises to define, register, and control **which APIs are exposed** (and which are not). Provides **security policies**, **access control**, **versioning** of APIs.
3. **Security**: Enforces security policies like **OAuth**, **rate limiting**, **throttling**, and more. It also helps with **monitoring** and **logging**.
4. **API Analytics**: Offers analytics to track usage patterns, error rates, and API performance metrics.
5. **API Lifecycle**: It helps manage the entire lifecycle of an API (from design to deprecation).

---

### **Axway in General**

Axway is **widely used** across many industries, not just yours. Some of the use cases for Axway could include:

* **Banking & Financial Services**: Managing secure APIs to allow third-party services to interact with their systems.
* **Retail**: Managing the API traffic between web applications and internal systems.
* **Healthcare**: Securing API interactions between hospitals, pharmacies, and insurers.

### **Axway API Management Solutions Include**:

* **Axway API Gateway**: A powerful tool to secure, scale, and monitor APIs.
* **Axway Amplify**: A platform that helps businesses with API integration and delivery.
* **Axway Centralized Analytics**: For monitoring and analyzing API traffic.

### **Axway’s Role in Your Project**

In your specific project, it seems that **Axway** is playing the role of **API Governance**. You are using it for managing and securing your APIs (defining which are allowed, handling access control, etc.). When you get errors like **403 Forbidden** for new APIs, it's because **Axway hasn't registered or authorized that API** yet.

### **Short Explanation for Interview/Clarity:**

> *“Axway is an API management and governance platform used for securing and managing APIs. It allows enterprises to define, monitor, and control which APIs are exposed to clients. In our case, Axway is used to ensure that only approved and registered APIs are accessible. When new APIs are deployed but not registered, Axway blocks them, leading to 403 errors.”*

---

So, **Axway** is a product used for API management and **is not something unique to your project**. It’s widely used in the industry for complex API ecosystems.

# **Your Frontend Setup: Micro Frontends Using Web Components**

You have:

* One **Main Angular app** (like `wecode-frontend`)
* Several **sub-applications** (small Angular apps or other apps), built as **Web Components**

Each **sub-app** is:

* In a **separate Git repo**
* Built **independently** (just like backend services)
* Deployed separately (maybe to some cloud storage, CDN, or server)

These sub-apps are **Web Components** — meaning:

* They are compiled into **custom HTML elements** (like `<student-app></student-app>`, `<teacher-app></teacher-app>`, etc.)
* They are **framework-agnostic** (once built, you can use them in any app, not just Angular)

---

# **How Main Frontend Loads These Web Components**

### 1. **Build and Host**

Each micro frontend (web component) is built separately → produces **JavaScript bundles** (e.g., `student-app.js`).

These JS bundles are uploaded somewhere (S3 bucket, Azure blob storage, or static servers).

---

### 2. **Main App Loads Dynamically**

In the **main Angular app**:

* You have a **configuration (like in package.json, or a config file)** where you define:

  * URL to load the web component (JS file)
  * Name of the custom element (e.g., `<student-app>`)

* When user navigates to a certain route (say `/students`),
  → The main app dynamically **loads that JS bundle** at runtime
  → Browser **registers** the new web component
  → You **render the custom element** like a normal HTML tag

**Example**:

```html
<!-- Inside Main Angular App -->
<student-app></student-app>
```

**Behind the scenes**:

* Main app downloads `student-app.js`
* Registers it
* Shows the Student Application seamlessly inside the main app

---

# **Summary of the Full Flow**

| Step | What happens                                                                |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Each web component is built separately and hosted somewhere                 |
| 2    | Main Angular app has a config mapping URL and web component name            |
| 3    | When user navigates to a specific route, the main app loads the JS bundle   |
| 4    | Browser registers the Web Component                                         |
| 5    | Main app renders the custom element like a normal Angular component         |
| 6    | Web component runs its own Angular code internally, independent of main app |

---

# **Bonus: Why this Micro Frontend Architecture?**

* Teams can develop/deploy **independently**
* Faster builds (small apps instead of a huge monolith)
* Different tech stacks possible (though all yours are Angular for now)
* Easy scaling and modularization

---

# **Small Interview-Ready Summary**

> *“In our project, we use a micro frontend architecture where each web component is a separately developed and deployed application. The main Angular app dynamically loads these web components based on user navigation. It treats them like standard HTML elements, allowing independent deployment and scaling of different parts of the application.”*

---

# **1. What is Docker?**

**Docker** is a tool that **packages** your application (code + dependencies + environment) into a **Docker Image**.
That image can run **anywhere** (on your laptop, server, cloud) — exactly the same way.

### **Why do we use Docker?**

Because:

* No more "It works on my machine" problem
* The same Docker image can run in **dev**, **QA**, **stage**, **prod** — no surprises
* Easy to deploy, scale, and manage applications

---

### **Example**

Your **Student Service** (Spring Boot app) → You want to Dockerize it.

You write a **Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk
COPY target/student-service.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

When you run **`docker build`**, it creates a **Docker Image** → e.g.,
`student-service:v1.0`

This image contains:

* JDK
* Your compiled `.jar` file
* Everything needed to run it

---

# **2. What is Artifactory?**

**Artifactory** is like a **storage** or **repository** (just like Git stores code, Artifactory stores built artifacts).
In your case, it stores **Docker images** and maybe **JARs**, **NPM packages**, etc.

You can think of it as:

> *"A private DockerHub / Maven Central for your company."*

---

### **Why do we use Artifactory?**

Because:

* Company wants to store all Docker images **privately**
* You can **version** your images → `student-service:v1.0`, `v2.0`, etc.
* Secure access, faster downloads within organization

---

### **Example Flow**

| Step | What happens                                                                    |
| :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | You build Docker Image of Student Service on Jenkins                            |
| 2    | Jenkins **pushes** that image to **Artifactory** (your private Docker registry) |
| 3    | During deployment, Kubernetes pulls that image from Artifactory and deploys it  |

---

# **Your Project Flow — Docker + Artifactory**

1. **Developer** writes code (Spring Boot)
2. **Jenkins** builds the code → creates Docker image
   → e.g., `student-service:v1.2`
3. **Jenkins pushes** that image to **Artifactory** → `artifactory.wecode.com`
4. You update `.yaml` file (GitOps repo) with **new image tag**
   → e.g., `image: artifactory.wecode.com/student-service:v1.2`
5. **Spinnaker** sees the change and triggers deployment on Kubernetes
6. Kubernetes **pulls image** from Artifactory → runs it in a pod

## 1️⃣ **What is Microservices Architecture? (Clear and Crisp)**

> **Microservices Architecture** is an approach where an application is built as a **collection of small, independent services**, each responsible for a **specific business capability**, and they communicate with each other over **lightweight protocols** (like REST APIs, messaging queues).

### 🔹 **Core Characteristics**

| Principle                     | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Independent deployability** | Each service is deployed separately                                       |
| **Single Responsibility**     | Each service does **one business function**                               |
| **Decentralized Data**        | Each service **owns its data**, though in real world shared DBs exist too |
| **Technology Diversity**      | Services can use different languages / databases                          |
| **Resilience**                | Failure of one service doesn't bring down the entire system               |
| **Elastic Scaling**           | Services scale independently                                              |
| **DevOps Automation**         | CI/CD pipelines, containerization, orchestration (e.g., K8s)              |

## 2️⃣ **Your project — Full Microservices Architecture (Explained Clearly)**

Here's how **YOUR project** fits cleanly into a **modern microservices architecture**:

---

### 🖥️ **Frontend (Client Layer)**

* **Single Page Angular App (SPA)**
  → A modern frontend, loading dynamic web components on demand

* **Web Components** (micro-frontends pattern)
  → Each sub-module downloads `main.js` of that component dynamically
  → Managed via **Artifactory NPM registry**

* **Authentication (Frontend)**
  → Separate **Auth Repository (shared)** used as npm dependency
  → Integrates with **Okta**
  → On app load → Redirect to Okta → Get token → Pass token as Bearer in all API calls

---

### 🌐 **API Gateway Layer**

* **Apigee** (API Gateway)
  → Validates the bearer token from frontend (token verification)
  → Routes API requests to correct microservice backend based on **path**
  → Provides centralized:

  * Rate limiting
  * Authentication enforcement
  * Routing

* **Axway**
  → Acts as a **policy enforcement** and **validation layer**
  → Rejects API calls if APIs not configured correctly

---

### ⚙️ **Backend (Microservices Layer)**

* **Multiple Spring Boot Services** exposed like:
  → `apidev.xyz.com/payments`
  → `apidev.xyz.com/accounts`
  → … etc.

* **Service-to-Service Communication**
  → Via **Kafka (event-driven)** and **REST APIs**

* **Authentication (Backend)**
  → Separate **Spring Security Auth Repository**
  → Shared as Maven dependency in backend microservices
  → Uses annotations like `@RolesAllowed` → **Fine-grained API access control**
  → Validates roles and permissions automatically

---

### 🛢️ **Database Layer (Persistence)**

* **Polyglot Persistence (Multiple DBs)**
  → Oracle DB (for transactional services)
  → MongoDB (for document-oriented services)

* **Data Ownership**
  → Some services have **separate DB** (ideal microservices pattern)
  → Some share a **common DB** (practical compromise — real-world pattern)

---

### 📦 **Infrastructure & DevOps Layer**

* **Kubernetes (Azure Red Hat OpenShift)**
  → Used to deploy and manage all microservices
  → Scaling via **replicaCount**
  → Logs monitored via **Azure OpenShift** and **ElasticSearch (historical logs)**

* **GitOps (CI/CD)**
  → **GitOps repo** stores Kubernetes manifests
  → Only changes like `replicaCount` and `docker image tag`
  → On code push:

  1. CI builds Docker image
  2. Pushes to **Docker Artifactory**
  3. GitOps pulls new image tag and deploys via Kubernetes

* **Elastic Stack (ELK)**
  → Centralized logging and monitoring
  → Searchable logs for debugging, historical audits

---

### **📊 Documentation & Developer Experience**

* **Swagger/OpenAPI Docs**
  → All backend APIs are documented for developers

## **📝 How to explain in interview (summary answer)**

> "Yes, we follow a microservices-based architecture in our project. We have multiple Spring Boot-based services like Payments and Accounts, independently deployed and exposed behind Apigee API Gateway. Our frontend is an Angular SPA that integrates with Okta for authentication. Backend services communicate using REST APIs and Kafka for async processing. We use a combination of Oracle and MongoDB for persistence. Kubernetes on Azure OpenShift manages our deployments via GitOps pipelines. CI/CD builds Docker images and pushes to Artifactory. We have centralized logging using Elastic Stack and document all APIs using Swagger. We also enforce fine-grained API security using Spring Security with role-based access controls."

# 📝 **Advanced Microservices Interview Q\&A (Customised to Your Project)**

---

### **Q1. What is microservices architecture and how is it applied in your project?**

**Answer:**
Microservices architecture breaks a large application into small, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.

In our project, we have multiple Spring Boot-based microservices such as **Payments**, **Accounts**, etc., exposed as independent APIs (`apidev.xyz.com/payments`, etc.). These services are behind an **Apigee API Gateway**, and they communicate using **REST APIs** and **Kafka** (for asynchronous messaging). Each service is independently deployed via **Kubernetes** and CI/CD pipelines.

---

### **Q2. How do you manage authentication and authorization in your microservices?**

**Answer:**
Authentication is handled using **Okta**. Our Angular SPA redirects users to Okta for login, and once authenticated, we receive a **Bearer token** which is sent in all API requests.

At the API Gateway level (**Apigee**), this token is validated.
For backend services, we have a shared **Spring Security Auth repository** (added via Maven dependency) which uses annotations like `@RolesAllowed` to enforce role-based access control on individual APIs. This ensures fine-grained authorization.

---

### **Q3. How does your project handle service-to-service communication?**

**Answer:**
We use both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** mechanisms:

* **REST APIs** for direct service calls (when immediate response is required)
* **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous event-driven communication (e.g., notifying Payments service after a transaction event)

---

### **Q4. Do your microservices share databases or have separate databases?**

**Answer:**
We follow a **hybrid approach**:

* Some services have **separate databases** (ideal microservices pattern for loose coupling)
* Some services **share a common database** (practical compromise due to legacy systems)

We use both **Oracle** (relational) and **MongoDB** (NoSQL) depending on the service's requirement.

---

### **Q5. How do you ensure scalability and high availability of services?**

**Answer:**
We deploy all microservices on **Kubernetes (Azure Red Hat OpenShift)**.
We configure **replicaCounts** in GitOps repo to scale services horizontally by increasing pods.
If load increases, we simply update the replica count, and Kubernetes deploys more pods. Apigee handles load balancing between them.

---

### **Q6. How does your CI/CD pipeline work for microservices deployment?**

**Answer:**
We use a **GitOps-based CI/CD** pipeline:

1. Code changes trigger a build pipeline.
2. A Docker image is built and pushed to **Docker Artifactory**.
3. GitOps repo is updated with the new image tag.
4. Kubernetes automatically pulls the new image and deploys it.

This ensures **automated, consistent deployments**.

---

### **Q7. How do you monitor and debug your microservices in production?**

**Answer:**
We use **Elastic Stack (ELK)** for centralized logging.
All logs from different services and Kubernetes pods are forwarded to **ElasticSearch** for searching and analysis.
We also check **Azure OpenShift** pod logs for real-time debugging.

---

### **Q8. How is API documentation managed in your project?**

**Answer:**
All backend APIs are documented using **Swagger / OpenAPI** specifications.
This helps both internal and external developers to understand and consume the APIs easily.

---

### **Q9. How do you handle failures and retries in your microservices communication?**

**Answer:**

* For **REST APIs**, we implement **retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff and **circuit breakers** using libraries like Resilience4J or Spring Retry.
* For **Kafka**, failed messages are handled using **dead letter queues (DLQ)** so that failed events can be retried or analysed later.

---

### **Q10. How does your project ensure secure communication between microservices?**

**Answer:**

* All service-to-service calls use **HTTPS** for encrypted communication.
* **Kafka** communication is secured via **SSL** and **authentication** (SASL).
* API Gateway (Apigee) and backend services validate **Bearer tokens** and enforce **role-based access** via Spring Security.

---

### **Q11. How do you manage configuration across environments in microservices?**

**Answer:**
We use **GitOps repositories** to maintain Kubernetes YAML files per environment.
Configurations like replica counts, Docker image tags, environment-specific variables are managed through these YAMLs.
Secrets (like DB passwords) are managed using **Kubernetes Secrets**.

---

### **Q12. How does your project handle schema changes when services share a database?**

**Answer:**
We carefully coordinate schema changes by:

* Using **backward-compatible changes** (adding columns, not dropping)
* Managing DB migrations via **Liquibase/Flyway**
* Communicating clearly with teams when schema changes affect multiple services

Whenever possible, we prefer **separate databases** to avoid this complexity.

---

### **Q13. What is the role of Axway in your architecture?**

**Answer:**
Axway acts as an **API validation and policy enforcement layer**.
It validates incoming API requests, enforces policies, and returns meaningful errors if an API is not configured properly.
This adds an extra layer of governance and robustness before requests reach backend services.

---

### **Q14. What challenges have you faced working in microservices architecture?**

**Answer:**
Some challenges include:

* **Distributed transactions** when multiple services need to update data together (we mitigate using eventual consistency and compensating transactions)
* **Debugging across services** (we mitigate using centralized logging via Elastic and correlation IDs)
* **Schema management** for shared databases (we mitigate via cautious DB changes and clear communication)
* **Service discovery and versioning** (we mitigate via Apigee Gateway and clear versioned APIs)

---

### **Q15. How do you ensure backward compatibility when updating services?**

**Answer:**
We follow **API versioning** and ensure that new changes are **backward compatible**.
Old consumers can continue using v1 APIs while new features are added to v2 APIs.
We test both old and new API versions thoroughly before deployment.

---

---

# ✅ **How to use this?**

→ Practice these answers **in your own words** but keep all the technical depth
→ Be ready to give **real project examples** (like I’ve shown)
→ Interviewers want both **concept clarity** + **real-world experience** = **You’ll stand out**

---

Excellent — here’s both:
① **5 super advanced microservices interview questions (with model answers based on your project)**
② **System Design questions (with hints to answer confidently)**

---

# ① **5 Super Advanced Microservices Interview Q\&A (Architect Level)**

---

### **Q16. How do you manage data consistency across microservices in your project?**

**Answer:**
We primarily follow **eventual consistency**.
When multiple services need to update related data, we use **Kafka events** to propagate state changes asynchronously.

For example, when a payment is successful, **Payments service** publishes an event to Kafka.
**Accounts service** consumes this event and updates account balances.
We avoid distributed transactions to reduce coupling and instead design with **idempotent operations** and **compensating transactions** where necessary.

---

### **Q17. How does your project ensure observability in a distributed microservices architecture?**

**Answer:**
We ensure **observability** via:

* **Centralized Logging:** All services log to **ElasticSearch** for search and visualization.
* **Tracing (if asked, mention future-proofing):** We are evaluating **distributed tracing** solutions (like OpenTelemetry or Jaeger) to trace requests across services end-to-end.
* **Metrics:** Kubernetes gives pod-level metrics. We plan to enhance with **Prometheus** + **Grafana** in the future for application-level metrics.

We also use **correlation IDs** in logs to trace a request as it passes through multiple services.

---

### **Q18. How do you manage microservices versioning and backward compatibility in your project?**

**Answer:**
We expose **versioned APIs** (`/v1/payments`, `/v2/payments`) behind **Apigee API Gateway**.

When releasing a new version:

* We maintain **old versions** for existing consumers.
* We ensure **backward compatibility** by supporting optional fields, avoiding breaking schema changes.
* Deprecation is done gradually with communication to clients.

For internal service-to-service APIs, we ensure **interface backward compatibility** and test both old and new consumers before deployment.

---

### **Q19. How do you manage secrets and sensitive configurations across microservices?**

**Answer:**
We use **Kubernetes Secrets** to securely manage sensitive data (like DB passwords, API keys).

Secrets are:

* Encrypted at rest (Kubernetes feature)
* Mounted into pods as environment variables or files
* **Access-controlled** via Kubernetes RBAC (only specific services can access specific secrets)

We avoid hardcoding secrets or checking them into Git repositories.

---

### **Q20. How do you ensure fault tolerance and resilience of your microservices?**

**Answer:**
We follow multiple strategies:

* **Retry and Timeout:** All inter-service REST calls have retry logic and timeouts.
* **Circuit Breaker:** We plan to use **Resilience4j** for circuit breaker patterns (if a service is down, avoid overloading it).
* **Kubernetes Self-healing:** Kubernetes automatically restarts failed pods and reschedules them if nodes crash.
* **Kafka DLQs:** Failed Kafka messages go into **Dead Letter Queues** for retries or manual intervention.
* **Horizontal Scaling:** We can scale up pods quickly via Kubernetes `replicaCount`.

---

# ② **System Design Questions (With Approach Hints)**

These may be asked to see if you can apply microservices concepts to design.

---

### **Q1. Design a payment processing system using microservices (similar to your Payments service)**

**Approach Hint:**

* **Services:** Payments, Accounts, Notifications
* **Communication:** REST for Payments-Accounts, Kafka for async events (payment success → notify)
* **API Gateway:** Apigee to expose APIs securely
* **Authentication:** Okta + token validation
* **Database:** Separate DB per service (Payments Oracle, Notifications MongoDB)
* **Scalability:** Kubernetes scaling
* **Logging:** Elastic
* **Resilience:** Retry, DLQ, circuit breaker

---

### **Q2. How would you handle schema evolution if Accounts and Payments share a DB table?**

**Approach Hint:**

* Use **backward compatible schema changes**
* **Blue-green deployments** or **feature toggles** to minimize downtime
* Coordinate schema rollout with **DB migration tools** (Liquibase/Flyway)
* Gradually migrate to **separate schemas** (ideal future)

---

### **Q3. Design a secure service-to-service communication mechanism.**

**Approach Hint:**

* **HTTPS** between services
* **Mutual TLS** (optional advanced answer)
* **OAuth2 tokens** for service-to-service auth (Okta can issue service tokens)
* Use **Spring Security** for RBAC
* **Kubernetes NetworkPolicies** (optional) to restrict pod communication

---

### **Q4. Design a microservices logging and monitoring architecture.**

**Approach Hint:**

* **Elastic Stack (ELK)** for centralized logging
* **Correlation ID** propagation between services
* **Prometheus + Grafana** (optional advanced monitoring)
* **Kibana dashboards** for log visualization
* Alerts on errors/timeouts via **Elastic** or **Prometheus AlertManager**

---

### **Q5. Design a deployment strategy for rolling out a new version of Payments service without downtime.**

**Approach Hint:**

* Use **Kubernetes Rolling Update** strategy
* Alternatively, do **Blue-Green deployment** (2 sets of pods, switch traffic)
* Ensure backward compatibility of APIs
* Use **health checks** to ensure new pods are healthy before switching
* Gradually **increase traffic** to new version (Canary Deployment — optional)

| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**                                     | Apigee (handles auth, routing, rate limiting)                                                                  |
| **Circuit Breaker**                                 | (Optional / Future) — Resilience4j for fault tolerance in REST/Kafka                                           |
| **Saga (Orchestration/Choreography)**               | For distributed transactions (payments + accounts), Kafka-based async updates ensure eventual consistency      |
| **Event Sourcing**                                  | Kafka (events persist history of state change, e.g., payment processed)                                        |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Read-heavy APIs fetch data from cached or denormalized sources (MongoDB) while writes propagate via Kafka      |

## 🗣️ **Sample Interview Intro (Project Elevator Pitch)**

> "I work on a microservices-based architecture where our Angular SPA interacts with multiple Spring Boot services exposed via Apigee API Gateway. We leverage Okta for authentication (OAuth2), Kafka for event-driven communication, and a hybrid Oracle-MongoDB strategy for persistence. Our services follow patterns like Saga for distributed transactions, Database-per-service where applicable, and are deployed on Kubernetes using GitOps for seamless CI/CD. We ensure observability through Elastic logs and fault tolerance using retries and pod isolation."

---

# 🎯 **Advanced Microservices — Interview Q\&A (Tailored to Your Project)**

---

### 1️⃣ **What is Microservices Architecture? How is it applied in your project?**

> Microservices architecture breaks a large application into a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service has its own functionality, data, and deployability.

**In my project:**
We have independent Spring Boot services like **Payments**, **Accounts**, etc., each exposed via **Apigee API Gateway**. Some have separate DBs (Oracle/MongoDB), and others share DBs depending on the domain requirement. They communicate via **REST** and **Kafka**.

---

### 2️⃣ **How is authentication handled?**

> We use **Okta (OAuth2)** for user authentication. The token obtained post-login is passed as a **Bearer token** to the backend APIs.

**Backend:**
Apigee validates tokens. APIs enforce roles via **Spring Security** using a shared **Auth service** (maven dependency). `@RolesAllowed` annotations protect endpoints without rewriting auth logic.

---

### 3️⃣ **How does service-to-service communication work?**

> Primarily using **REST APIs** and **Kafka** (for async).

* **Kafka**: For publishing events like "Payment Initiated", "Account Updated" → consumed by relevant services asynchronously (**Saga pattern** used for distributed transactions).
* **REST**: For synchronous queries like getting account details.

---

### 4️⃣ **How do you ensure data consistency across services?**

> We follow **Eventual Consistency** via **Kafka** (Saga pattern).

Example:
Payment → emits `PaymentCompleted` → Account service consumes event → updates account balance.

---

### 5️⃣ **What patterns ensure reliability and fault tolerance?**

✅ **Retry + Timeout** in REST and Kafka calls
✅ **Circuit Breaker** (we plan Resilience4j for flaky services)
✅ **Bulkhead**: K8s replica isolation prevents cascading failures
✅ **ElasticSearch** centralized logs + correlation IDs for tracing

---

### 6️⃣ **How is CI/CD handled?**

> We follow **GitOps** for K8s deployments.

1. Code pushed → triggers build → Docker image → **Docker Artifactory**
2. GitOps repo updates tag → K8s cluster pulls new image
3. Deploy via Helm / K8s manifests
4. Configs managed in GitOps YAML (replicaCount, image tag)

---

### 7️⃣ **Explain API Gateway usage in your project.**

> **Apigee** acts as our API Gateway.

✅ Authenticates Bearer tokens
✅ Routes requests to correct microservice (payments/accounts)
✅ Handles rate-limiting, logging, API versioning
✅ Provides developer portal + Swagger docs

---

### 8️⃣ **Why did you use both Oracle and MongoDB?**

> Based on data modeling needs:

* **Oracle** → transactional, relational (e.g., customer info)
* **MongoDB** → unstructured, scalable reads (e.g., logs, user preferences)

This follows **Polyglot Persistence** and **Database-per-service** pattern.

---

### 9️⃣ **How do you monitor and debug microservices?**

✅ **ElasticSearch + Kibana** → central logging
✅ **Azure OpenShift** → pod-level logs
✅ **Correlation ID** → track request flow across services
✅ **Apigee Analytics** → API usage + latency

---

### 🔟 **What are the main challenges in microservices you faced?**

* Handling **distributed transactions** → solved via **Kafka Saga**
* **Service discovery** → handled statically via Apigee/K8s DNS
* Managing **configs & secrets** → solved using **GitOps + K8s Secrets**
* Maintaining **observability** → Elastic stack + tracing
