To answer confidently in **system design interviews**, you need to go beyond basic definitions of HTTP/HTTPS and be able to discuss:

* The **evolution** of HTTP versions (1.0 to 3.0)
* **Key features and differences**
* How these versions impact **performance**, **concurrency**, and **scalability**
* Where **HTTPS** fits in (security layer)

---

## ✅ **What is HTTP?**

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a **stateless, application-layer** protocol used for transmitting hypermedia (like HTML) over the web. It follows the **client-server model**, where the client (e.g., browser) sends a request and the server responds.

---

## 📜 **HTTP Versions: 1.0 → 3.0**

### 🔹 **HTTP/1.0 (1996)**

* **Connection model**: One TCP connection per request-response pair. After response, connection closes.
* **No persistent connections** by default.
* **No support for request pipelining or multiplexing**.
* **No host header** initially → couldn’t host multiple domains on one IP (fixed via `Host:` header extension).

**Issues:**

* High **latency** (TCP handshake for every request).
* Inefficient for **web pages with multiple resources** (images, CSS, JS).

---

### 🔹 **HTTP/1.1 (1997 - still widely used)**

* **Persistent connections** (`keep-alive`) → reuse the same TCP connection for multiple requests/responses.
* **Pipelining**: Allows sending multiple requests without waiting for responses (but **no parallelism**—must be answered in order).
* Introduced **chunked transfer encoding**, **cache control headers**, and **host header** (support for virtual hosting).
* Still **head-of-line blocking** at the application layer (browser waits for response in order of requests).

**Impact:**

* Better than 1.0 in terms of **performance** and **bandwidth usage**.
* Still struggles with **concurrent loading of many resources**.

---

### 🔹 **HTTP/2 (2015)**

* **Binary protocol** instead of text → more compact and efficient.
* Supports **full multiplexing**: multiple concurrent streams over a single TCP connection.
* **Header compression** using HPACK.
* Server **push**: Server can proactively send resources before client requests.
* Still uses **TCP** underneath.

**Benefits:**

* **No head-of-line blocking at HTTP level** (but still at TCP level).
* Drastically improved **latency** and **resource loading**.
* Widely adopted by major websites and CDNs.

---

### 🔹 **HTTP/3 (2022 - emerging standard)**

* Based on **QUIC** protocol (by Google), which runs on **UDP**, not TCP.
* **Built-in TLS 1.3** for encryption.
* Supports **independent streams** → no head-of-line blocking **at transport layer**.
* Faster **connection establishment** (0-RTT, 1-RTT).
* Better for **mobile networks** due to improved recovery and less congestion.

**Key Differences:**

* Uses **UDP** instead of TCP.
* Fixes TCP-level head-of-line blocking.
* Improved **resilience** to packet loss and network changes (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to 4G).

---

## 🔒 **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)**

* Not a separate protocol — it’s **HTTP over TLS (SSL)**.
* Ensures:

  * **Encryption** (data is secure)
  * **Authentication** (server is who it says it is)
  * **Integrity** (data is not tampered with)

**How it works:**

* TLS handshake happens before HTTP communication.
* Uses **public-key cryptography** to exchange symmetric keys.
* Required for security-sensitive applications (e.g., login, payments).
* Mandatory for **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3** (they don't work without TLS).

## 🚀 How to Talk About This in Interviews

### 1. **Explain Evolution:**

> "HTTP started with 1.0 as a simple stateless protocol, but performance and scalability were poor. 1.1 improved by keeping connections alive and adding basic pipelining. HTTP/2 overhauled this with binary framing and multiplexing, and HTTP/3 took a bigger leap by moving to QUIC over UDP, eliminating TCP’s head-of-line blocking."

### 2. **Discuss Impact:**

> "In system design, choosing HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 can significantly improve latency and throughput, especially for resource-heavy or mobile-first applications."

### 3. **Mention HTTPS:**

> "HTTPS is essential in modern systems for security and privacy. It uses TLS to encrypt HTTP, and it's mandatory for HTTP/2 and 3."
