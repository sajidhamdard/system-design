### 📁 What is **HDFS Architecture**?

**HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)** is the **storage layer** of the Hadoop ecosystem. It is designed to **store very large files** reliably across a **cluster of machines** and provide **high throughput** access to application data.

## 🏗️ **High-Level Architecture of HDFS**

HDFS follows a **Master-Slave architecture**, and consists of three main components:

| Component              | Role                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NameNode**           | 🧠 The **master** that manages the file system namespace and metadata                          |
| **DataNode**           | 💾 The **workers/slaves** that store actual data blocks                                        |
| **Secondary NameNode** | 🛠️ Performs periodic checkpointing of NameNode metadata (⚠️ not a backup or standby NameNode) |

### 🔍 Key Concepts

#### 1. **NameNode (Master)**

* Stores **metadata** only: filenames, directories, block locations, permissions.
* Does **not** store actual data.
* Keeps everything in **memory**, so it's fast but a single point of failure (unless using HA setup).

#### 2. **DataNode (Slave)**

* Stores actual **blocks of data** on local disks.
* Periodically sends **heartbeats** and **block reports** to the NameNode.
* Responsible for **serving read/write** requests from clients.

#### 3. **Secondary NameNode**

* Periodically merges the **edit logs** and **fsimage** (metadata) from NameNode.
* Helps reduce recovery time if the NameNode restarts.
* ⚠️ It's **not** a hot backup or automatic failover.

## 📦 HDFS File Storage Strategy

* Files are **split into blocks** (default 128 MB).
* Each block is **replicated** (default 3 copies) for **fault tolerance**.
* Replicas are placed:

  * One on local rack
  * One on a different rack
  * One on a random DataNode

## 🧭 Workflow: How HDFS Works

### 📝 Writing a File

1. Client contacts **NameNode** for metadata (e.g., block locations).
2. NameNode provides **list of DataNodes** for each block.
3. Client writes data **directly to DataNodes** (not through NameNode).
4. Data is **replicated** as per the replication factor.

### 📖 Reading a File

1. Client contacts **NameNode** for block locations.
2. Client reads **directly from DataNodes** that have the required blocks.

## ✅ Key Features of HDFS

| Feature                   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fault Tolerant**        | Uses replication to handle node failures          |
| **High Throughput**       | Optimized for large datasets and streaming reads  |
| **Scalable**              | Easily add more nodes for storage and throughput  |
| **Write Once, Read Many** | Optimized for batch processing, not random writes |
| **Rack Awareness**        | Smart placement of replicas for fault isolation   |

## 📊 Summary (Interview-Friendly Answer)

> “HDFS is a distributed file system that stores data across a cluster in a fault-tolerant and scalable way. It uses a **master-slave architecture** with a **NameNode** for metadata and **DataNodes** for actual storage. Files are split into blocks and replicated across nodes to ensure availability and durability. HDFS is optimized for **high throughput, large-scale data processing**, and forms the storage backbone of the Hadoop ecosystem.”
