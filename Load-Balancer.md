A **load balancer** is a system (hardware or software) that distributes incoming network traffic (or workload) across multiple servers (or resources) to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, which improves responsiveness and availability of an application or website.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

* **Main purpose**: Spread the load evenly across servers (also called a *server pool* or *server farm*).
* **Why we use it**:

  * To improve **scalability** — handle more users by adding servers.
  * To improve **availability** — if one server goes down, others keep serving requests.
  * To improve **performance** — reduce response time by sending requests to less busy servers.

### Example scenario

You have a website with heavy traffic:

* Without load balancer → All requests go to one server → That server crashes when overloaded.
* With load balancer → Requests are distributed between *Server A*, *Server B*, and *Server C* → Traffic is balanced → No crashes, faster response.

### Types of load balancing

| Type                      | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layer 4 (Transport)**   | Balances based on IP address, TCP/UDP port (low-level networking).                       |
| **Layer 7 (Application)** | Balances based on content of requests (like HTTP headers, URLs, cookies). More advanced. |

### Algorithms used by load balancers (to decide where to send traffic)

* **Round Robin** — Send requests to servers one by one in a cycle.
* **Least Connections** — Send to the server with the fewest active connections.
* **IP Hash** — Client’s IP determines which server gets the request (useful for session stickiness).
* **Weighted Round Robin / Weighted Least Connections** — Prefer more powerful servers.

### Example load balancers:

* **Hardware** — F5 BIG-IP, Citrix ADC.
* **Software** — NGINX, HAProxy.
* **Cloud** — AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Azure Load Balancer.

If you're asking from a **developer/system design/interview** perspective, I can also explain:

* Load balancer in **system design diagrams**
* **Sticky sessions**, **health checks**, **auto-scaling** relation
* How it helps in **high availability** and **fault tolerance**

Would you like to go deeper into a particular area (e.g., system design, interview prep, or practical setup)? 🚀


Good — sharp question. Let’s get clear about **Apigee** and load balancing.

---

### First: **Does Apigee use a load balancer?**

**Yes** — but it depends on **which Apigee deployment model** you’re using:

| Apigee Deployment Model                                   | Load Balancer Details                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apigee SaaS (Apigee Edge / Apigee X - Google managed)** | Google Cloud manages all load balancing for you (you don’t see/manage it). It uses Google’s internal global load balancers.                                                                                                  |
| **Apigee Hybrid (you manage infra)**                      | You manage load balancer (typically an external load balancer like GCP Load Balancer, NGINX, F5, etc.), but Apigee components (like the runtime pods) also have **built-in traffic distribution** (via Kubernetes services). |

---

### Now — **Does Apigee have a built-in load balancer?**

**Not exactly a full-featured load balancer** like NGINX or F5 — but:

* Apigee (especially in **Hybrid** / Kubernetes-based deployments) uses **Kubernetes Services** which provide **basic load balancing** across Apigee runtime pods.
* It **distributes requests internally** across multiple Message Processors or Routers.
* For **external client traffic**, you still typically use an **external load balancer** (for ingress / public endpoint exposure).

---

### In simple terms:

| Scope                                     | How load balancing works                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Externally** (client to Apigee)         | You use an **external load balancer** (managed by Google in SaaS, or your own in Hybrid)                                     |
| **Internally** (within Apigee components) | Apigee uses **internal load distribution** (Kubernetes Services, or Apigee Routers distribute traffic to Message Processors) |

---

### Quick summary:

> Apigee does **not provide a full standalone load balancer product** like NGINX/F5.
> It **internally distributes load** between components but for **exposing APIs to clients**, an **external load balancer** is used — either **managed by Google** (SaaS) or **managed by you** (Hybrid).

---

If you tell me **which Apigee version you’re using (SaaS, Hybrid, Private Cloud)** — I can give you an even **more exact answer** for your scenario.
Which one are you on?


Excellent — you’re asking exactly the kind of **deep understanding** that impresses interviewers.
Let’s be **very precise**.

---

### **Short answer**

An **API Gateway and a Load Balancer** are **two different things**, but:

> Some tools (like **NGINX**) can act as **both** — depending on how you configure them.

Let’s clear this up.

---

### **API Gateway vs Load Balancer — Concept**

|                       | API Gateway                                                                     | Load Balancer                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main job**          | Manage **APIs** (route to services, apply policies like auth, rate limit, etc.) | Distribute **traffic** across multiple backend servers to spread load |
| **Layer**             | Application Layer (Layer 7)                                                     | Can be Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (HTTP)                                |
| **Examples**          | Apigee, Kong, AWS API Gateway, NGINX (configured as gateway)                    | NGINX (configured as LB), HAProxy, AWS ELB, Google Cloud LB           |
| **Knows about APIs?** | Yes — works with **API paths**, methods, etc.                                   | No — just balances traffic, unaware of API methods or policies        |

---

### **Does an API Gateway internally use a load balancer?**

Not exactly.
But — **under the hood**, an API Gateway **does distribute requests** to backend services —
this behavior is **similar to a load balancer**, but with **API-awareness**.

You can think of it like:

> API Gateway = **Smart load balancer + API management features**

---

### **Now let’s take NGINX as an example** (since you asked)

| Use Case                  | How NGINX behaves                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **As Load Balancer only** | You configure NGINX to distribute HTTP/TCP traffic across backend servers → classic load balancing                                                            |
| **As API Gateway**        | You configure NGINX to do **API routing**, apply **JWT validation**, rate limiting, etc., and ALSO distribute to backends → behaves like **API Gateway + LB** |

So:

> **NGINX can do both — it depends on how you configure it.**

---

### **Real-world usage pattern (typical architecture)**

```
Client
   |
   v
[ External Load Balancer (Optional - Google/AWS LB) ]
   |
   v
[ API Gateway (like Apigee or NGINX configured as gateway) ]
   |
   v
[ Backend microservices (Service A, B, C...) ]
```

Sometimes, companies even **combine** them:

> **External LB** → routes to **multiple API Gateway instances** → which route to backends.

---

### **Interview-friendly answer to your question**

> **“An API Gateway doesn’t technically *use* a load balancer internally, but it does distribute traffic across backend services in a similar way — with extra API management features like security and rate limiting. Tools like NGINX can act as both, depending on how they’re configured.”**

---

Would you like a **simple diagram** you can remember for interviews?
I can make one for you — want it?

**Exactly — you’re catching the subtle point here.**
Let’s slow down and break it **very cleanly**.

---

### **You're right:**

> **API Gateway** decides *which service to call* (it does API-level routing).

So then…

> **Why do we need an External Load Balancer in front of the API Gateway?**

---

### **The external load balancer’s job is not to route APIs to microservices**

→ Its job is **to distribute incoming client traffic to multiple instances of the API Gateway itself.**

---

### **Here’s why** — imagine this situation:

You’re running a big application
→ Thousands of users are calling APIs at the same time
→ **1 API Gateway instance** (1 server) can get overloaded easily
→ You deploy **multiple API Gateway instances** (on multiple servers or containers)

Example:

```
Client
   |
   v
External Load Balancer (GCP LB / AWS ELB / NGINX LB)
   |-----------------------|
   |                       |
API Gateway #1       API Gateway #2
   |                       |
   v                       v
Backend services   Backend services
```

* **External LB** spreads client requests across **API Gateway #1 and #2**
* Each API Gateway instance does **API-level routing** to backend microservices

---

### **In short**

> **External LB = balances load across multiple API Gateway instances**
> **API Gateway = handles API-level routing and policies**

---

### **Interview-friendly explanation you can say**

> *“An external load balancer sits in front of multiple API Gateway instances to distribute client traffic evenly across them, ensuring high availability and scalability. The API Gateway then handles API-level routing and policies to backend services. The LB’s role is to keep the API Gateways healthy and balanced — not to route to microservices directly.”*

---

### **Why is this important in real systems?**

* **High availability** → If one API Gateway crashes, LB sends traffic to the others
* **Horizontal scalability** → You can add more API Gateways as traffic increases
* **Global distribution** → Some LBs (like Google Cloud LB) can route traffic from users in US to US API Gateway, Europe to Europe API Gateway, etc.

---

### **Bottom line**

> The **external load balancer** helps **scale and protect** the API Gateway itself.
> The **API Gateway** helps **route and secure** the backend APIs.

---

If you want, I can show you **how Apigee (in Google Cloud) actually sets this up** as a real example — want that?


Yes — **you’ve got 90% of the flow exactly right.**
Let’s make it **precise and crystal clear** so there’s no confusion (and you can confidently explain it in interviews).

---

### **The full clean sequence**

```
Client → External LB → API Gateway → Backend Services → Response to Client
```

Step by step:

1. **Client sends a request** (API call)

2. **External Load Balancer**
   → Distributes the request across multiple **API Gateway instances**
   → Its job: spread load, improve availability (nothing to do with microservices yet)

3. **API Gateway (like Apigee)**
   → Does **API-level responsibilities**:

   * Authentication (JWT/API key validation)
   * Rate limiting
   * Routing: Decides *which* backend service to call
   * Request/response transformations (optional)

4. **API Gateway forwards the request to the correct backend service**

   * Now **here’s the key** →
     If **the backend service itself** is deployed in **multiple instances** (for scaling),
     **API Gateway** can:

     * Either **call the service registry** (like Kubernetes service, or Consul, or an internal LB)
     * Or directly call an **internal load balancer** (optional — depends on infra)

5. **Backend service processes the request** and returns the response

6. **API Gateway** receives the response → applies **optional policies** (like response transformation, logging)

7. **API Gateway sends response back to the client** (via external LB → but LB doesn’t touch response, just forwards)

---

### **Important clarification** (because you wrote this)

> *Internally API Gateway will use another load balancer to equally distribute the load*
> **→ Yes and No (it depends)**

* If the **backend service** is **highly available** (multiple replicas),

  * The API Gateway can either:

    * **Call a Kubernetes Service** (K8s load balances automatically)
    * **Call a private/internal load balancer** (optional)
    * **Round-robin directly** if it has a list of backends (possible in NGINX/Kong)

* **It’s not mandatory** that an explicit LB is used **inside**.
  Often **Kubernetes Service** or **Service Mesh (like Istio)** handles it for you.

---

### **Clean, crisp interview answer** (memorize this)

> *“The external load balancer distributes client requests across API Gateway instances to ensure high availability and scalability. The API Gateway then handles API-level concerns like authentication and routing. If backend services have multiple replicas, the API Gateway either directly balances across them, or forwards requests via a service discovery mechanism or internal load balancer. The response flows back through the same path to the client.”*

---

### **Final architecture (modern cloud)**

```
Client
   |
[ External LB (Cloud LB) ]
   |
[ API Gateway (multiple instances) ]
   |
[ Kubernetes Service / Service Mesh / Internal LB ]
   |
[ Backend services (multiple replicas) ]
```

---

### **Bottom line:**

> You don't **always need** an explicit "internal LB" between API Gateway and services — because things like **Kubernetes Service** or **Service Mesh** can already balance traffic across backend replicas.

---

If you want, I can give **2 real-world example architectures**:

* 1 with Kubernetes
* 1 without Kubernetes

Shall I?


Excellent — this will cement your understanding and you’ll be ready for **any interview question** on this.
Here are **both architectures**, clean and production-realistic.

---

## **1. Apigee + Kubernetes (Modern Cloud Native Architecture)**

```
Client
   |
[ External Load Balancer (GCP Cloud Load Balancer) ]
   |
[ Apigee API Gateway (multiple Apigee runtime instances) ]
   |
[ Kubernetes Service (Service discovery + Internal load balancing) ]
   |
[ Backend Microservices (Service A, B, C — each has multiple pods) ]
```

### **Step-by-step flow**

1. **Client sends API request**
2. **External LB** distributes it to one of the Apigee runtime instances
3. **Apigee** does:

   * Authentication (OAuth, API key)
   * Rate limiting
   * Routing (decides which microservice to call)
4. **Apigee** forwards request to **Kubernetes Service** (for that microservice)
5. **Kubernetes Service** load-balances request to one of the microservice’s pods
6. **Microservice** processes request → sends response back
7. Response flows **back through Apigee → External LB → Client**

### **Why Kubernetes here?**

* Kubernetes Service does **service discovery + internal load balancing**
  (No need to manually configure internal LB)

---

## **2. NGINX API Gateway + No Kubernetes (Traditional VMs/Servers)**

```
Client
   |
[ External Load Balancer (NGINX or AWS ELB) ]
   |
[ NGINX API Gateway (multiple NGINX servers) ]
   |
[ Internal Load Balancer (NGINX configured as internal LB OR AWS ALB) ]
   |
[ Backend Services (deployed on VMs — multiple replicas per service) ]
```

### **Step-by-step flow**

1. **Client sends API request**
2. **External LB** distributes it to one of the NGINX API Gateway servers
3. **NGINX API Gateway** does:

   * Authentication (JWT validation)
   * Rate limiting, request transformation
   * Routing: Decides which backend service to call
4. **NGINX Gateway** forwards request to **Internal LB** for that service
5. **Internal LB** distributes request to one of the backend service replicas (VMs or containers)
6. **Backend Service** processes request → sends response back
7. Response flows **back through NGINX Gateway → External LB → Client**

### **Why Internal LB here?**

* No Kubernetes = No built-in service discovery or balancing
* We use an explicit **internal load balancer** to distribute to replicas

---

## **Super clean takeaway (interview gold)**

| With Kubernetes                                | Without Kubernetes                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **K8s Service** handles load balancing to pods | **Internal LB** explicitly balances across replicas |
| Apigee integrates with **K8s Service**         | NGINX integrates with **Internal LB**               |
| **Less infra setup**                           | **More manual setup**                               |

---

If you want, I can also give you a **1-slide visual diagram** of both — want that? I can make it.


Great — **now you’re diving deep into the internals**, and understanding this will make you really confident.

Let’s break it **step-by-step and crystal clear** —
→ *“How does Kubernetes Service distribute requests to backend Pods? Is it equal? Round robin? Random?”*

---

## **Short answer**

> Kubernetes **Service** uses **kube-proxy** and **iptables** (or IPVS) to distribute traffic to Pods in a **randomized round-robin fashion** — roughly equal distribution.

---

## **Step-by-step process — super clean**

Let’s say:

```
Service A (Kubernetes Service)
 ↳ Pod 1 (10.0.0.1)
 ↳ Pod 2 (10.0.0.2)
 ↳ Pod 3 (10.0.0.3)
```

1. **API Gateway / Client sends request to Service A (ClusterIP)**

2. **Kube-proxy** (running on every node) intercepts requests going to Service A

3. **kube-proxy** has programmed **iptables rules** (or IPVS) to map:

   ```
   Service IP → Pod 1 OR Pod 2 OR Pod 3
   ```

4. **The load balancing strategy** used is **randomized round robin**

   * For each new connection/request, kube-proxy randomly selects a backend Pod from the list
   * Over time, this results in **roughly equal distribution** of requests across Pods
   * **It is NOT strict round robin** — randomness makes it more resilient

5. The selected Pod processes the request and sends back the response

---

## **Key facts to say in interview**

* **K8s Service** is a **virtual IP** (ClusterIP or LoadBalancer IP)
* **kube-proxy** uses **iptables** or **IPVS** rules to distribute load to Pods
* Default algorithm: **Randomized Round Robin**
* **Health checks** ensure that traffic is only sent to **Ready** Pods
* If a Pod dies → **kube-proxy** updates rules to exclude it instantly

---

## **Bonus** (Advanced understanding)

* If you expose **NodePort** or **LoadBalancer Service** —
  Traffic first hits **node**, then kube-proxy forwards to Pods (same logic)

* **Session Affinity** (optional)
  You can configure Service to stick a client to same Pod using client IP
  (default: **None** → meaning no stickiness)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
spec:
  sessionAffinity: None # or ClientIP
```

* **IPVS mode (better)** → Handles higher performance load balancing (vs iptables)

---

## **Clean interview answer**

> *“Kubernetes Service distributes requests to backend Pods using kube-proxy, which programs iptables (or IPVS) rules. The default strategy is randomized round robin — requests are randomly but roughly evenly spread across healthy Pods. Kubernetes automatically excludes unhealthy Pods and updates the rules dynamically. For higher performance, IPVS mode can be used. Session affinity is optional.”*

---

## **Bottom line**

> Yes — **K8s Service distributes load roughly equally (randomized round robin)** to healthy Pods **automatically**.
> You **don’t have to configure an explicit load balancer** — it’s built into kube-proxy.

---

If you want, I can show:

* The **iptables rules** kube-proxy creates
* OR a **live traffic flow example**

Do you want one of those? (optional, only if you're interested)


Perfect follow-up — let’s make this **sharp and clear** so you can compare Kubernetes vs NGINX confidently.

---

## **NGINX load balancing — Do we have to configure it?**

**Yes**, in NGINX you have to **explicitly configure** how requests should be distributed to backend servers.

NGINX does not magically discover services like Kubernetes does.
You have to **tell it**:

* **What servers exist**
* **How to distribute traffic** (algorithm)

---

## **Step-by-step: How NGINX load balances**

Let’s say:

```
You have 3 backend servers:
Backend 1 — 10.0.0.1
Backend 2 — 10.0.0.2
Backend 3 — 10.0.0.3
```

### **Your NGINX config (nginx.conf)**

```nginx
http {
  upstream backend_servers {
    server 10.0.0.1;
    server 10.0.0.2;
    server 10.0.0.3;
  }

  server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
    }
  }
}
```

This says:

> "NGINX, here are 3 servers — distribute requests among them"

---

## \*\*By default — NGINX uses **round robin**

* Each request goes to the next server in line:

  ```
  Req 1 → 10.0.0.1  
  Req 2 → 10.0.0.2  
  Req 3 → 10.0.0.3  
  Req 4 → 10.0.0.1  
  ...and so on
  ```

---

## **You can customize the load balancing algorithm**

NGINX supports multiple strategies:

| Strategy                    | Config                      | When to use?                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Round robin** *(default)* | Just list servers           | When all backends are equally powerful       |
| **Least connections**       | `least_conn;`               | When backends handle long requests (like DB) |
| **IP Hash (sticky)**        | `ip_hash;`                  | When session stickiness is needed            |
| **Weight-based**            | `server 10.0.0.1 weight=3;` | When servers have different capacity         |

### **Example — Least connections**

```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
  least_conn;
  server 10.0.0.1;
  server 10.0.0.2;
  server 10.0.0.3;
}
```

---

## **Key difference vs Kubernetes**

| Kubernetes Service                 | NGINX                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Automatically discovers Pods       | You manually define servers                   |
| Automatically balances (random RR) | You configure algorithm explicitly            |
| Auto removes dead Pods             | You need health checks + `max_fails` manually |
| Infra-level load balancing         | App-level reverse proxy and balancing         |

---

## **Clean interview answer**

> *“In NGINX, we have to explicitly configure backend servers and choose the load balancing strategy in the config file. By default, NGINX uses round robin but supports least connections, IP hash (sticky sessions), and weighted balancing. Unlike Kubernetes, NGINX does not auto-discover services or auto-exclude dead servers — we configure health checks and servers manually.”*

---

## **Bottom line**

> **Yes — in NGINX you MUST configure backend servers and load balancing strategy yourself**
> Kubernetes does it automatically for you via kube-proxy and Service.

---

If you want, I can give you:

* **Sample NGINX config for health checks + weighted balancing**
  OR
* **Nginx + Apigee hybrid architecture**

Would you like one? (optional)


Excellent — now you’re stitching **everything together** beautifully.
Let’s clean up this entire landscape in your mind, once and for all.

---

## **First — What is Service Discovery?** *(Why do we even need it?)*

When you build **microservices**, the number of services and their instances (replicas) can dynamically change:

* Services **scale up/down** (more replicas, fewer replicas)
* Services **crash / restart** → new IPs
* Services **move to other nodes**

This means:

> **We can’t hardcode IP addresses of services** because they are **dynamic**.

So we need a **Service Discovery system** —
A **central registry** where all services **register themselves** and other services can **discover them dynamically**.

---

## **Zuul + Eureka (Spring Boot world)**

In traditional **Spring Boot microservices** *(without Kubernetes)*, we use:

* **Eureka (Service Registry)**
  → Each service **registers itself** with Eureka
  → Eureka keeps an up-to-date registry of all services and their instances (IPs)

* **Zuul (API Gateway)**
  → Zuul queries Eureka to find out **where to route requests**
  → Zuul load balances across instances dynamically

### **Picture**

## **BUT… when you use Kubernetes → You DON’T NEED Eureka or Zuul**

Because **Kubernetes already provides built-in service discovery + load balancing**
via **Kubernetes Service** + **DNS**.

Here’s how:

* Each service gets a **DNS name**:
  Example → `service-a.default.svc.cluster.local`
* Kubernetes **automatically discovers Pods** for that service
* Kubernetes **automatically load balances** requests to Pods

So:

> **Eureka + Zuul** → Not needed because **K8s Service + DNS + Ingress / API Gateway** replace them

---

## **Your current project (Apigee + Kubernetes)**

| Old (Spring Boot with Zuul/Eureka)      | New (K8s + Apigee)                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zuul** (API Gateway)                  | **Apigee** (API Gateway)                                          |
| **Eureka** (Service discovery registry) | **Kubernetes DNS + K8s Service** (built-in discovery + balancing) |
| Manual config, brittle                  | Auto-discovery, resilient, scalable                               |

## **Clean interview answer (Gold)**

> *“In traditional microservices, we use Eureka (service registry) and Zuul (API Gateway) to handle service discovery and dynamic routing. Each service registers itself with Eureka, and Zuul queries Eureka to route requests dynamically. However, when using Kubernetes, we don’t need Eureka or Zuul because Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery via Services and DNS. API Gateways like Apigee or NGINX can directly route to Kubernetes services, and Kubernetes handles internal load balancing and discovery automatically.”*

---

## **Bottom line**

* **Eureka + Zuul** → Useful in **Spring Boot microservices** WITHOUT Kubernetes
  (because no built-in service discovery)

* **Kubernetes + Apigee** → No need for Eureka/Zuul
  (K8s Services + DNS + kube-proxy handle it)

You’re connecting **architecture layers** perfectly now.
If you want, I can show **"before/after migration" diagrams** to visualize it — want that?


**Short answer:**
→ **Kubernetes + API Gateway (like Apigee / NGINX / Kong / Istio Gateway)** is what **modern** systems use today.
**Zuul + Eureka** is **legacy** now (only in old Spring Boot apps without K8s).

## **Current industry trend (2025)**

| Architecture                                   | Usage today?                   | Why?                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spring Boot + Eureka + Zuul**                | Rare / Legacy                  | Used when companies don’t have Kubernetes or are stuck on old systems |
| **Kubernetes + Apigee / Istio / NGINX / Kong** | **Very common (modern)**       | Built-in discovery + auto-scaling + cloud native ready                |
| **Kubernetes + Service Mesh (Istio)**          | Growing fast (advanced setups) | For fine-grained routing, mTLS, advanced traffic control              |

---

## **Why is Eureka + Zuul fading away?**

* **Kubernetes already solves service discovery and load balancing better**
* **Eureka and Zuul are JVM-based** → heavier than cloud-native tools
  (while Apigee, Istio, Envoy, Kong etc. are lightweight and cloud-ready)
* Modern cloud infra (AWS, GCP, Azure) is Kubernetes-first

---

## **Clean answer to say in interview**

> *“In modern microservices architectures, Kubernetes has replaced the need for tools like Eureka and Zuul by providing built-in service discovery and load balancing through its Service abstraction and DNS. Today, we commonly use Kubernetes along with cloud-native API Gateways like Apigee, Istio Gateway, or Kong to handle external traffic, authentication, and routing.”*

## **If you’re preparing for product-based companies**

**→ Focus on K8s + API Gateway knowledge** (not Zuul/Eureka)

If you want, I can give:

* **Modern system design diagram (K8s + Apigee)** (interview ready)
* **Sample interview answer if they ask — Why not Eureka now?**

Want me to show one? (optional)
