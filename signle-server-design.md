**Single server design** (or **single-server architecture**) simply means that **all application components — everything — run on a single server** (one machine handles everything).

### ✅ **What runs on the single server?**

* Application logic (backend code)
* Database
* Web server (like Apache, Nginx)
* File storage (if needed)

Basically — **one box does it all**.

---

### 🖥️ **Simple example**

Your personal project runs like this:

* You have a server (say, one VM or one laptop)
* You install MySQL (database), Node.js (backend), and Nginx (web server)
* Users connect to that single server for everything

---

### ✅ **Advantages**

* **Simple setup** (easy to deploy and maintain)
* **Low cost** (only one machine needed)
* **No network communication overhead** between components (because everything is local)

---

### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* **Single point of failure** — if the server crashes, everything is down
* **Limited scalability** — can’t easily handle high traffic or large workloads
* **Hard to upgrade** — CPU, RAM, disk on one machine can only scale so far

---

### 🛠️ **When is single server design used?**

* Small apps or MVPs (minimum viable product)
* Personal projects
* Internal tools (used by very few users)

---

### ✅ **Summary (in one line)**

> **Single server design = All components run on one server → simple but not scalable**
