Yes — **Apigee** (by Google) essentially **acts as a reverse proxy**, but with **API management** capabilities layered on top.

Here’s how to think about it:

---

### **What is Apigee?**

Apigee is an **API management platform**. It helps companies expose their backend services (APIs) to external developers, partners, or internal teams — in a secure, scalable, and manageable way.

---

### **Does Apigee act like a reverse proxy?**

**Yes — at its core, Apigee is a reverse proxy.**
Here’s why:

* **Client calls Apigee (not the backend directly).**
* **Apigee forwards (proxies) the request to your backend services**, gets the response, and returns it to the client.
* **Backend services are hidden** from external clients — just like a reverse proxy does.

---

### **What extra does Apigee provide (on top of reverse proxy)?**

| **Basic Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx)** | **Apigee (API Gateway + Reverse Proxy)**             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Forwards requests to backend          | Forwards requests to backend                         |
| SSL termination (optional)            | SSL termination                                      |
| Hides backend servers                 | Hides backend servers                                |
| —                                     | **Rate limiting (throttling)**                       |
| —                                     | **API key validation / OAuth / JWT validation**      |
| —                                     | **Analytics (API usage, latency, errors)**           |
| —                                     | **Caching / Response transformation / Mediation**    |
| —                                     | **Developer portal (API documentation, onboarding)** |
| —                                     | **Monetization / Billing APIs (optional)**           |

---

### **In short**

Apigee = **Reverse proxy + API Gateway + API Management tools**
→ It mediates and manages API traffic, not just forwards it.

Perfect — let’s break **Apigee’s request forwarding flow** down step by step, nice and clear.

---

## **Apigee Request Flow (Simplified)**

Imagine a client (mobile app, website, etc.) trying to access your API through Apigee.

### **Actors**

* **Client** → the consumer of your API
* **Apigee Edge** → API proxy (where policies run)
* **Backend Service** → your real server (e.g., microservices, database, etc.)

---

### **Step-by-Step Flow**

| **Step** | **Action**                                          | **What happens**                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | **Client sends API request**                        | The client sends a request (e.g., `GET https://api.company.com/orders`) — this hits **Apigee**, not the backend directly.                                    |
| 2        | **Apigee Proxy receives the request**               | Apigee has an **API Proxy** configured, which listens at a base path (e.g., `/orders`) and is mapped to your backend.                                        |
| 3        | **Policies (Pre-routing)**                          | Apigee applies **pre-routing policies**, such as: authentication (OAuth/JWT/API key validation), IP whitelisting, rate limiting, logging, etc.               |
| 4        | **Apigee forwards the request to backend (Target)** | Once validated, Apigee **forwards the request to the backend service**, using the **Target Endpoint URL** configured in Apigee Proxy.                        |
| 5        | **Backend service processes request**               | Your backend does its job — processes the request and returns a response to Apigee.                                                                          |
| 6        | **Policies (Post-routing)**                         | Apigee applies **response policies**, like response transformation (XML → JSON), masking sensitive fields, caching, logging response metrics, etc.           |
| 7        | **Apigee returns the response to client**           | Finally, Apigee sends the processed response back to the client. **The client never directly interacts with your backend** — Apigee mediates the whole time. |

---

### **Simple Diagram**

```
Client  →  Apigee Proxy →  Backend Service
   ↑            ↓              ↑
Response  ←  Policies  ←  Response
```

---

### **What’s configurable in Apigee Proxy?**

* **Pre-flow policies:** Run on every request/response.
* **Conditional flows:** You can configure different logic (routes, policies) based on:

  * HTTP method (GET vs POST)
  * URL path (e.g., `/orders`, `/users`)
  * Headers, query params, etc.
* **Target Endpoint:** Where Apigee should forward requests (your backend URL).

---

### **In short:**

Apigee forwards requests **like a smart reverse proxy** — adding security, analytics, transformations, and control before sending anything to your backend.

---

## **Why do companies use Nginx instead of Apigee (sometimes)?**

| **Nginx**                                                                 | **Apigee**                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lightweight, fast reverse proxy and web server                            | Full-featured API management platform                                                  |
| Open-source (Free) / Cheap (Nginx Plus)                                   | Expensive (Apigee is an enterprise-grade product, \$\$\$)                              |
| Simple use cases: Reverse proxy, SSL termination, load balancing, caching | Complex API management: Auth, analytics, rate limiting, developer portal, monetization |
| Config files are simple and fast to deploy (few lines)                    | Config is heavier (many XML files, policies, Apigee Edge UI, etc.)                     |
| No vendor lock-in (runs anywhere easily)                                  | Tied to Apigee infrastructure (especially if using Apigee SaaS)                        |
| No learning curve for small teams                                         | Steep learning curve, more governance overhead                                         |
| Extremely fast and low latency                                            | Slightly higher latency (because policies & management layers sit in between)          |

---

## **In short:**

### **Companies use Nginx when they need:**

✅ Simple reverse proxy / load balancer / HTTPS handling
✅ Fast, lightweight, low-cost solution
✅ Full control over infrastructure (on-prem or cloud)
✅ Not much API management (no need for developer portals, monetization, etc.)

---

### **Companies use Apigee when they need:**

✅ Securely expose APIs to external developers or partners
✅ Centralized API management — rate limiting, analytics, auth, monetization
✅ Compliance, governance, and enterprise API lifecycle management
✅ Need to track API usage, billing, quota enforcement
✅ Mature API strategy across many teams/products

---

## **Example scenarios**

| **Use Case**                                                                                | **Recommended** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Reverse proxy internal microservices with SSL and load balancing                            | Nginx           |
| Expose public APIs to partners with usage tracking, quotas, and developer onboarding        | Apigee          |
| Serve static content + reverse proxy dynamic backend                                        | Nginx           |
| Expose APIs securely with OAuth, rate limiting, analytics + monetization (API-as-a-product) | Apigee          |

---

## **Why many companies use BOTH (Hybrid)**

→ **Nginx at infrastructure level** (reverse proxy, load balancer)
→ **Apigee at API management level** (external API exposure)

> Many companies **use Nginx behind Apigee** to handle microservice routing, while Apigee manages the external API gateway functionality.

---

## **Bottom line**

You choose **Nginx** or **Apigee** **based on complexity and budget**.
If you just need simple reverse proxying or load balancing → **Nginx** is perfect and fast.
If you need to manage APIs **as a product** with analytics, quotas, security → **Apigee** shines (but costs \$\$\$ and adds complexity).


---

👉 **Cost is one of the biggest reasons** companies prefer Nginx **when they don’t need all the "heavy" API management features**.

Let’s be super clear and realistic here:

---

## **Why cost matters practically**

| **Apigee (Enterprise API Gateway)**                                                                                                      | **Nginx (Reverse Proxy)**                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **License cost is high** — Apigee is priced based on number of API calls, environments, features (Advanced security, monetization, etc.) | **Open source = Free** (Nginx OSS); **Nginx Plus** (commercial version) is relatively cheap |
| **Ongoing costs** — If you need SLA, support, and enterprise features → \$\$\$                                                           | **Minimal costs** — You can even run Nginx on small VMs with almost zero infra cost         |
| **Tied to Google Cloud (for Apigee X)** or to Apigee SaaS infra (for Apigee Edge) — cloud costs + licensing                              | **Runs anywhere** — On-premise, cloud, containers, bare metal (total control)               |

---

## **When COST makes the decision obvious**

✅ **Small to mid-sized companies** → Will almost always start with **Nginx** because it handles 80% of their needs at almost zero cost.

✅ **Internal APIs (not exposed to partners)** → No need for heavy API management → Nginx wins.

✅ **Startup or side project** → Nginx is way more practical.

---

## **BUT (Important)**

**Cost is not the *only* thing** — it's just the **biggest blocker** for using Apigee unnecessarily.

Even **big companies** don’t blindly use Apigee everywhere because:

* It adds **latency**
* It requires **more governance + maintenance**
* It adds **complexity**
  → So, they’ll use **Nginx internally** and **Apigee only at API boundaries** (external partners, public APIs).

---

## **In short**

✅ **Yes — Nginx is free + fast + simple → Big reason it’s so popular.**
✅ **But don’t forget — sometimes companies "choose Nginx" not just because of cost but because Apigee’s extra features aren’t even needed** for their simple use case.
